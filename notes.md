# Notes

- re-do the design with 6s instead of 5s
- 8mm/3mm for the sliders
- use whatever font we want
- put a spot in the middle for replaceable put drill holes in the bottom piece
- add 3mm drill holes (6 per ring, in the spaces - and in the two outer rings as
  well)
- add drill holes for the PLA sliders (12 pairs 40mm apart)
