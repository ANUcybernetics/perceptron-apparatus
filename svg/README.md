# SVG output

This folder is full of SVGs which are generated by the `PerceptronApparatus` module. They are used to generate the CNC files which are used to cut the boards for the Perceptron Apparatus.

So you _probably_ don't want to modify these files directly---you should instead update the Elixir code which generated them.
