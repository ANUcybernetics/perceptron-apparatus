## Description

The basic `mix perceptron` task generates an SVG file. While there is some
grouping/layering of elements, it is not optimized for InDesign. This task aims
to separate the SVG elements into layers for better organization and
manipulation in InDesign.

In particular, I'd like to have the following layers:

- `drill` (has only the "red dot" drill holes)

the rest TBC after chatting with Sam
