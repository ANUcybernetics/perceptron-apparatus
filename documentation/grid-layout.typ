    == Algorithm

    + draw your input image on the 6Ã—6 grid, where each cell A0--A35 represents how much "ink" is in that cell (0 = white, 1 = black)

    + for each slider in ring A (input ring), set the value based on the corresponding cell in the input image grid

    + for each slider in ring A:
      - read slider value
      - read value of same-numbered slider in ring *B0*
      - multiply the two values (using slide rule ring) and _adjust_ the value of slider *C0* by the result

    + repeat step 2 for each bank of sliders in ring B (*B1*, *B2*, etc.) until all of the sliders in ring C have been fully adjusted
      - once that's done, if any slider in ring C has a negative value, set it to 0

    + repeat the process of steps 2 and 3, but starting with ring C (instead of ring A)

    + once all the sliders in ring E have been fully adjusted, the slider in ring E with the highest value is the output value

    === Notes

    This procedure assumes that the weights (rings B and D) are pre-populated with the correct values.

    To _adjust_ by a value means to add or subtract the value from the current value of the slider. To _set_ the value means the slider should show that value (regardless of the previous value).
