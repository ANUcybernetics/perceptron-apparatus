## Description

This project wasn't initially designed as an Ash project - the initial
specifications for the various layer configs were just maps.

The refactor (to use Ash) has made some things easier, but I'd like to go
through the codebase and ensure that it's following the best practices for Ash
projects. The @deps/ash/usage-rules.md file contains a list of best practices
for Ash projects.
