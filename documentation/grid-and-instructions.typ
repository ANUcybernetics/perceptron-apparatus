    == Algorithm

    + draw your input image on the 6Ã—6 grid (whatever you like!)

    + for each cell #label[A0]--#label[A35] set the corresponding slider in ring
      #label[A] (input ring) based on how much "ink" is in that cell (white = 0,
      black = 1)

    + for each slider in ring #label[A]:
      - read slider value
      - read value of same-numbered slider in ring #label[B0]
      - multiply the two values (using slide rule ring) and _adjust_ the value
        of slider #label[C0] by the result

    + repeat step 3 for each bank of sliders in ring #label[B] (#label[B1],
      #label[B2], etc.) until all of the sliders in ring #label[C] have been
      fully adjusted
      - once that's done, if any slider in ring #label[C] has a negative value,
        set it to 0

    + repeat the process of steps 3 and 4, but starting with ring #label[C]
      (instead of ring #label[A])

    + once all the sliders in ring #label[E] have been fully adjusted, the
      slider in ring #label[E] with the highest value is the output value

    === Notes

    This procedure assumes that the weights (rings #label[B] and #label[D]) are
    pre-populated with the correct values.

    To _adjust_ by a value means to add or subtract the value from the current
    value of the slider. To _set_ the value means the slider should show that
    value (regardless of the previous value).
