# TODO

- darken the "< 0" regions of radial sliders (ReLU indicators)
- add 3mm drill holes (6 per ring, in the spaces - and in the two outer rings as
  well)
- add drill holes for the PLA sliders (12 pairs 40mm apart)

- have single rotating rule, make it the outer ring, perhaps a "knurled" edge?

- (maybe) add ash_phoenix just to get tidewave/ash_ai support? (although seems a
  bit gross)
- check with Sam about the most helpful way to output the different svg layer
