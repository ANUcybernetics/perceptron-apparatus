## Description

Now that there's a vertical "cut line" indicating where the top plate will need
to be cut (because it's too big to etch in one piece) I'd like to rotate the
outer slide rule markings so that the cut line doesn't go through any markings.
About 10 degrees clockwise should do it I think.
