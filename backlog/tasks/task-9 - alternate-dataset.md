As well as the MNIST dataset (well, a 6px by 6px downscaled version of it at
least) it'd be great to have another canonical ANN problem which:

- has a readily-available training set
- can be meaningfully represented in 36 input dimensions
- can be usefully trained to give outputs using 6 hidden nodes and 10 output
  nodes (i.e. can be done on this apparatus)

I guess we could just use another famous image dataset, similarly downsampled
and greyscaled. But if there's another dataset which could also work which isn't
image data that would be super cool.
