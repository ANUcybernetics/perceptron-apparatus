## Description

Currently, the bottom slider channels are (for both azimuthal and radial rings)
are drawn with the same round-end-cap line, but just a different thickness (and
even that's done in CSS).

I need to extend the bottom slider channel (the wider one) so that it extends an
extra 8 units at either end, to accomodate a pill-shaped captive slider bottom.
