# TODO

- central QR code feature (removable)
- put a spot in the middle for replaceable put drill holes in the bottom piece
- add 3mm drill holes (6 per ring, in the spaces - and in the two outer rings as
  well)
- add drill holes for the PLA sliders (12 pairs 40mm apart)

- add mix task for generating an svg file
- (maybe) add ash_phoenix just to get tidewave/ash_ai support? (although seems a
  bit gross)
- check with Sam about the most helpful way to output the different svg layer
  files
